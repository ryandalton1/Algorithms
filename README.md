# Algorithms
Here is a collection of some cool algorithms code examples. There is less code here than in my Data Structures examples mainly because in my studies of Algorithms I did a lot more hand written work than in Data Structures so feel free to ask me about Algorithms that are not listed here!

The code is written in Python, some parts by teachers but that is clearly outlined in the README within each folder
