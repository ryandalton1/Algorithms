I hear the train a-comin, it's rolling 'round the bend  And I ain't been kissed lord since I don't know when  The boys in Crescent City don't seem to know I'm here  That lonesome whistle seems to tell me, Sue, disappear    When I was just a baby my mama told me, Sue  When you're grown up I want that you should go and see and do  But I'm stuck in Crescent City just watching life mosey by  When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry    I see the rich folks eatin' in that fancy dining car  They're probably having pheasant breast and eastern caviar  Now I ain't crying envy and I ain't crying me  It's just that they get to see things that I've never seen    If I owned that lonesome whistle, if that railroad train was mine  I bet I'd find a man a little farther down the line  Far from Crescent City is where I'd like to stay  And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
