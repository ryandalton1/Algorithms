Kruskal's takes a graph and creates a minimum spanning tree which is a tree with the lowest edge weight possible that connects every node.

Written here is code originally coded by Aric Hagberg the modified by Shivendra Agrawal then finilized by me Ryan Dalton. The default code was to create a graph containing the major US cities and the distance between them.

The part I implement is the actual function of Kruskal's which populates a tree with the MST of this graph. Which would be useful for many things, for example if we were constructing one giant highway through the country or a railway.

Follow this map and it will connect all the cities with the least amount of material used.
